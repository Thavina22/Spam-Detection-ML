# Spam-Detection-ML

📧 Spam Detection Using Machine Learning:

📌 Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning based Spam Detection system built using Python.
The model classifies messages or emails as Spam or Not Spam (Ham) using text preprocessing, feature extraction, and Machine Learning algorithms.

🚀 Features
Text Data Cleaning,

Data Preprocessing,

Feature Extraction from Text,

Spam Classification using Naive Bayes,

Model Accuracy Evaluation.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

🤖 Machine Learning Algorithm
Naive Bayes Classifier: Naive Bayes is used because it works efficiently for text classification and performs well even with smaller datasets.

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains labeled messages classified as Spam or Ham.
It is used for training and testing the Machine Learning model.
